* yet another telegram bot
i want to write a shitty telegram bot but don't want to pull in a huge dependency. Telegram bots can't be that hard, right?
** considerations
- writing out all the models is a chore. We could try autogenerating them from the api docs.
  For now we allow the user to provide whatever they want via Handle(kind, func(T) error)
